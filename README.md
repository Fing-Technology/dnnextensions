# DNNExtensions

This is a solution that houses most of the DNN extensions that I manage for the community. It also is 
used to display how a DNN solution should be architected as a best practice, which includes several 
very useful MSBuild scripts.  I've presented this as a topic at DNNCon Palm Beach 2014.
